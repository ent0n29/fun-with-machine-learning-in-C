## trying to build a XOR gate with a single neuron

it is possible to train a single neuron in order to make an OR, AND & NAND gates.
But how we do a XOR gates, since it can't be modeled with 1 single neuron. Well, if we write XOR in terms of AND, OR & NAND, like for example (x|y) & ~(x&y).
Now we can model a XOR-gate using 1 neuron!
